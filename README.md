Define the recommendation task you want to tackle, and precisely describe the data you will use for training, evaluating and testing;

Build a recommender system using the data provided;

If possible, build a second recommender using another approach and compare the results (eg compare CF to content-based recommendation, it depends on your taste and on data available).
